    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>6 Slices of bacon</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of onion powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of garlic salt</li>
        <li>1lb of skinless, boneless chicken breast</li>
        <li>6 (6inch) flower tourtillas</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons of chopped red onion</li>
        <li>1 cup of shredded lettuce</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of shredded pepper Jack cheese</li>
        <li>2 plum tomatoes, seeded and chopped</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of ranch dressing, or to taste</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels.</li>
        <li>Whisk smoked paprika, onion powder, oregano, and garlic salt together in a shallow bowl. Coat chicken with seasoning, and cook on the prepared grill until no longer pink at the center and juices run clear, about 10 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place tortillas on the hot grill and heat until lightly grilled, 20 to 30 seconds per side.</li>
        <li>Slice chicken and place in warm tortillas. Top with shredded lettuce, red onions, shredded cheese, and chopped tomatoes. Drizzle with ranch dressing. Crumble bacon over top. Serve immediately.</li>
